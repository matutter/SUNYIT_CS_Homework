This is a Repo with homeworks I wrote for an introductory class at SUNYIT. If you're going to hire me, please know I keep these here for tutoring.


This repository is a summary of all programs and works done in CS108 for the fall 2012 semester @ SUNYIT.
All GHP (graded homework project) grades are approximately an 'A, give or take.'
