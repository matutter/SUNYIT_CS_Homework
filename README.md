Seriously don't copy the programs of this site. It's meant for tutoring only.  
If you're an idiot and need to read the Academic Integrity policy, or don't have integrity read the handbook around page 55.

Hi I'm mat
--------------
I'm a software engineer. I've working in the Telecom and Security industries.  I’m a polyglot. I write a lot of Python, C, and JS for fun. I’m also an embedded software developer who makes robots.  If you’re going to hire me don’t look here; this isn’t the good stuff. 

Try my [Gist]( https://gist.github.com/matutter "gist") for snippets or request a neat project. 
[CodeMassively]( https://gist.github.com/matutter "my website") is my website. 
mat@codemassively.com is my effective email. 
[Tweet](https://twitter.com/matutter”twitter”) me for anything.
