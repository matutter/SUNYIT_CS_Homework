Hi I'm mat
--------------
I'm a software engineer. I've worked in the Telecom and Security industries.  I’m a polyglot. I write a lot of Python, C, and JS for fun. I’m also an embedded software developer and I make robots.  If you’re going to hire me don’t look here; this isn’t the good stuff. 

Try my [Gist]( https://gist.github.com/matutter "gist") for snippets or request a neat project.    
[CodeMassively]( https://www.codemassively.com/ "my website") is my website.    
mat@codemassively.com is my effective email.   
[Tweet](https://twitter.com/matutter”twitter”) me for anything.

Seriously don't copy the programs off this site.   
It's meant for tutoring only.     
If you're an idiot and need to read the Academic Integrity policy, or don't have integrity read the handbook around page 55.
